Repository for my devops course

# üìö What i've learned
In my university DevOps course, I gained a foundational understanding of DevOps principles, including the importance of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement in the software development lifecycle. I learned the basics of Docker, focusing on containerization to ensure consistency across environments, as well as Kubernetes for orchestrating containerized applications at scale. The course introduced advanced tools such as Knative for serverless workloads on Kubernetes, Kyverno for policy enforcement in Kubernetes clusters, and Keptn for automating DevOps processes and enhancing reliability. Additionally, I learned about CI/CD pipelines, which emphasized the automation of testing and deployment for efficient, reliable software delivery.

# üìù Summary of my Last 2 blogs
### Blog 1
The blog ‚ÄúCI/CD: A beginner‚Äôs guide‚Äù provides a thorough overview of CI/CD, emphasizing its importance in speeding up software delivery while upholding high standards. It highlights how CI/CD practices facilitate automation in software development, reducing risks linked to code changes and fostering early bug detection. A comparison is made between traditional, linear development methods and CI/CD‚Äôs iterative technique, which allows for continuous integration of modifications, testing, and deployment. By promoting an automated workflow, CI/CD reduces errors, enhances collaboration, and streamlines the delivery of features and fixes. The blog also dissects key pipeline elements such as Source Code Management (SCM), automated builds, testing, deployment, and monitoring, clarifying the function of each stage in the overall process.

Additionally, the blog walks readers through the process of establishing a basic CI/CD pipeline, detailing important tools like Git for version control, Jenkins and GitLab CI for continuous integration, along with deployment tools such as AWS CodePipeline. It suggests best practices, including frequent commits, expedited builds, and thorough testing, to enhance CI/CD workflows. It also tackles typical CI/CD challenges, like cultural adjustments, legacy systems, infrastructure intricacies, and test automation, providing actionable solutions for each. In the end, the blog illustrates how a properly executed CI/CD pipeline fosters efficient and dependable software delivery, revolutionizing the development cycle by enabling quicker releases with minimized risk and enhanced quality.

### Blog 2
The blog "Dockerizing a Web Application" explains how to Dockerize Flask and Node.js applications, build their respective Docker images, and run them in isolated containers. It also demonstrates using Docker Compose for running both apps simultaneously, making multi-service app management simpler. The tutorial concludes with a guide to push images to Docker Hub for sharing and deployment across machines. The approach ensures consistent application performance across environments while introducing key DevOps tools. A valuable resource for developers integrating Docker into workflows. The examples used were of applications in react, node.js, with Flask, as they are commonly used tools for the Final-Year-Projects of my university's students.

# üí° Summary of my third Blog
The blog ‚ÄúContinuous Delivery with Keptn‚Äù focuses on Keptn as a totally free, open-source tool that helps to understand the optimization of Continuous Delivery processes in modern DevOps. Keptn has the benefit of streamlining the deployment pipelines and automating these so that integration issues, inconsistencies in the quality of deliveries, and difficulties in collaboration between the development and operations teams can be easily resolved. The blog elaborates on the architecture of Keptn: how the event-driven model of such various control and data plane components, such as the Control Plane and the Shipyard Controller, support seamless management at deployment time across all pipeline stages. Practical guidance is offered on how to install and use Keptn, along with configuring pipelines and implementing quality gates to monitor deployments effectively.

Keptn underlines its versatility in various use cases, from multistage delivery pipelines to self-healing, in the importance of this tool to complex cloud-native environments. It also demonstrates how Keptn integrates into the most popular DevOps tools and monitoring systems such as Prometheus, thus being completely automated in quality checks and triggering automatic remediation. Generally, Keptn is an improvement in the efficiency of the deployment process with simultaneous enhancement in service reliability. This means that the development team can focus on doing other things in innovation rather than redoing repetitive tasks and debugging. This event-driven framework places Keptn within a certain scope of value, especially for organizations seeking to improve their workflow, which is DevOps, within a cloud-native setting.
